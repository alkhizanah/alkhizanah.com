# alkhizanah.com

Awebsite for [Al Khizanah](https://github.com/alkhizanah) organization.

This project started as an exploration. While browsing the organization and its repositories, I realized there was no central place that presents the work, documentation, and vision in a structured way. So I decided to build one.

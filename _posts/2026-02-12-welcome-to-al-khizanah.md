We're excited to introduce Al Khizanah, a collective of developers building practical tools, shared infrastructure, and open documentation for reliable software delivery.

## Our Mission

At Al Khizanah, we believe in building software that matters. Our focus is on creating tools and solutions that solve real problems and make developers' lives easier. We're committed to:

- **Open Source First**: All our projects are open source and available for the community
- **Quality Over Quantity**: We prioritize well-tested, maintainable code
- **Developer Experience**: Tools should be a joy to use, not a burden
- **Community Driven**: We build together through collaboration and feedback

## Get Involved

We're always looking for contributors, feedback, and ideas. Here's how you can get involved:

1. **Explore the Docs**: Check out our [documentation](/alkhizanah.com/projects/) to learn more about each project
2. **Try the Code**: Clone our repositories and experiment
3. **Share Feedback**: Open issues, suggest features, or ask questions
4. **Contribute**: Submit pull requests with improvements or new features

## What's Next

Over the coming weeks and months, we'll be sharing:

- Technical deep-dives into Nur's design decisions
- Tutorials and guides for getting started
- Updates on new features and releases
- Community highlights and contributor stories

Stay tuned by watching our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/alkhizanah) or checking back here for updates.

## Join the Community

We're building something special, and we'd love for you to be part of it. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, there's a place for you in the Al Khizanah community.

Let's build great software together.
